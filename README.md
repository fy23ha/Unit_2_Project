### ELEC2645 Unit 2 Project
### Signal Generator & Signal Analyser

A command-line application. This tool allows users to generate common electrical waveforms with custom parameters and analyze existing waveform data files to extract key signal characteristics.

*** Overview ***  
This project splits functionality into two distinct modules handled by a central menu system:  

Signal Generation: Creates synthetic waveform data based on user inputs and visualizes it using gnuplot.  

Signal Analysis: Reads raw waveform data from text files and calculates physical properties like amplitude, frequency, and DC offset.  

*** Features ***  
Signal Generator:  
    ```Supports the generation of the following waveform types:  ```

        Sine Wave

        Square Wave

        Triangle Wave

        Sawtooth Wave

    Customizable Parameters:

        Amplitude (V)

        Frequency (Hz)

        DC Offset (V)

        Sample Rate (Hz)

        Duration (s)

    Output: Generates a waveform.txt file and displays a plot.

Signal Analyser:  

    Parses waveform data file (format: time,sample) to compute:
        Maximum Amplitude

        Frequency (calculated based on zero-crossing or peak detection)

        DC Offset (The mean voltage of the signal)

*** File Structure ***  

    main.c : contains the main menu logic and program controller.
    funcs.h: header file containing struct definitions and function prototypes.
    funcs1.c: implementation of Signal Generator functions.
    funcs2.c: implementation of Signal Analyser functions.
    waveform.txt: Default output file for generated signals (created at runtime).

*** Installation & Compilation ***  
  Prerequisites:  
     GCC Compiler (MinGW for Windows, standard GCC for Linux/macOS).  
     Gnuplot (Optional, but required to view the waveform graphs generated by the program).  

  Compiling the Code:  
     Open terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command:  
     For Linux / macOS, run:  
          ```gcc main.c funcs1.c funcs2.c -o main.out -lm```  
     For Windows, run:  
          ```gcc main.c funcs1.c funcs2.c -o main.exe -lm```  
  Running the Application:  
     For Linux / macOS, run:  
          ```./main.out```  
     For Windows, run:  
          ```./main.exe```
